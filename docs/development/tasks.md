# Development Tasks Tracking

This document tracks current development tasks, progress, and priorities to ensure continuity across development sessions and prevent loss of work progress if IDE issues or interruptions occur.

## Current Active Task

### 📋 **Task**: TitleChampionship Entity Comprehensive Testing
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Priority**: 🔴 High
- **Assigned Date**: 2025-07-03
- **Completed Date**: 2025-07-03

#### Task Description
Implement comprehensive testing coverage for the TitleChampionship entity across all 5 tiers of the testing architecture. TitleChampionship is a core business model that handles championship reigns with complex polymorphic relationships and date-based business logic.

#### Final Coverage Status
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Completed `tests/Unit/Models/TitleChampionshipTest.php` and `tests/Unit/Builders/TitleChampionshipQueryBuilderTest.php`
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Completed championship workflow and table integration tests
- ✅ **Authorization Tests**: Completed `tests/Feature/Authorization/TitleChampionshipAuthorizationTest.php`
- ✅ **Browser Tests**: Completed championship management and form modal browser tests
- ✅ **Page Objects**: Completed `ChampionshipIndexPage.php` and `ChampionshipDetailPage.php`

#### Implementation Plan (5-Tier Architecture)

##### Phase 1: Unit Tests ✅
- [x] **TitleChampionshipTest.php** - Model relationships, date calculations, polymorphic champions
- [x] **TitleChampionshipQueryBuilderTest.php** - Championship query scopes and filtering

##### Phase 2: Integration Tests ✅
- [x] **ChampionshipWorkflowIntegrationTest.php** - Championship awarding and management workflows
- [x] **ChampionshipTableIntegrationTest.php** - Championship display component integration

##### Phase 3: Authorization Feature Tests ✅
- [x] **TitleChampionshipAuthorizationTest.php** - Championship authorization through TitlesController

##### Phase 4: Browser Tests ✅
- [x] **ChampionshipManagementBrowserTest.php** - Championship ceremony and management workflows
- [x] **ChampionshipFormModalBrowserTest.php** - Championship assignment modal interactions

##### Phase 5: Page Object Classes ✅
- [x] **ChampionshipIndexPage.php** - Championship management page interactions
- [x] **ChampionshipDetailPage.php** - Championship detail workflows

##### Phase 6: Testing Standards Refactoring ✅
- [x] **Updated Testing Documentation** - Comprehensive testing standards in CLAUDE.md
- [x] **Applied AAA Pattern** - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern across all test files
- [x] **Named Routes Implementation** - Converted hardcoded URLs to named routes
- [x] **Datasets Integration** - Used Pest datasets for repetitive test scenarios
- [x] **Query Assertion Standards** - Proper SQL query testing patterns

#### Completed Requirements ✅
- **Date Calculations**: ✅ Comprehensive testing of `lengthInDays()` and duration calculations
- **Polymorphic Relationships**: ✅ Full testing of Wrestler vs TagTeam champion handling
- **Time-based Logic**: ✅ Current vs historical championship validation testing
- **Event Integration**: ✅ Match-based championship relationship testing
- **Factory States**: ✅ Current, ended, and specific date range state testing
- **Query Builder Scopes**: ✅ current(), previous(), latestWon(), latestLost(), withReignLength()
- **Authorization Patterns**: ✅ Comprehensive authorization testing through TitlesController
- **Browser Workflows**: ✅ Visual championship management and interaction testing

#### Technical Notes
- Polymorphic champion relationship (Wrestler or TagTeam)
- Complex date calculations for championship durations
- Multiple foreign key relationships (title, won_event_match, lost_event_match)
- Critical for match result processing and title management
- Factory states for current championships, historical reigns, and specific scenarios
