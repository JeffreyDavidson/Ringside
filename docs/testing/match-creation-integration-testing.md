# Match Creation Integration Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive integration testing approach for match creation workflows in the Ringside wrestling management system. These tests validate complex multi-entity interactions, business rule enforcement, and data integrity across the entire match creation pipeline.

## Match Creation Workflow Architecture

### Core Actions Hierarchy

```
AddMatchForEventAction (Master Orchestrator)
├── AddRefereesToMatchAction (Officiating Assignment)
├── AddTitlesToMatchAction (Championship Stakes)
└── AddCompetitorsToMatchAction (Competitor Management)
    ├── AddWrestlersToMatchAction (Individual Wrestlers)
    └── AddTagTeamsToMatchAction (Tag Team Assignment)
```

### Business Logic Flow

1. **Event Validation**: Verify event eligibility for new matches
2. **Base Match Creation**: Create match record with proper numbering
3. **Referee Assignment**: Assign qualified, available referees
4. **Title Assignment**: Add championship stakes with validation
5. **Competitor Assignment**: Add wrestlers/tag teams to match sides
6. **Validation & Rollback**: Ensure all business rules are satisfied
