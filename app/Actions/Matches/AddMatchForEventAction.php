    /**
     * Create a complete match for an event.
     *
     * This handles the comprehensive match creation workflow for an event:
     * - Validates match data integrity and business rule compliance
     * - Creates the match record with proper type, rules, and event association
     * - Assigns qualified referees to officiate with proper authority
     * - Associates championship titles at stake for title matches
     * - Adds all competitors (wrestlers and tag teams) with proper side allocation
     * - Ensures all match components are properly integrated and validated
     * - Maintains data consistency through transaction management
     *
     * BUSINESS RULES:
     * - Events must be scheduled and not yet completed
     * - Match types must be valid and supported by the system
     * - Competitors must be available and not conflicted for the event date
     * - Referees must be qualified and available for officiating
     * - Championship titles must be active if assigned to the match
     * - Matches must have proper competitor distribution for balance
     *
     * BUSINESS IMPACT:
     * - Creates complete match cards for fan engagement and ticket sales
     * - Establishes competition structure for storyline development
     * - Enables proper event planning and resource allocation
     * - Supports championship tracking and title change possibilities
     * - Facilitates payroll calculations and appearance fee management
     * - Drives revenue through match-based promotional marketing
