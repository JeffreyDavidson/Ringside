/**
 * Base class for all tag team actions.
 *
 * Provides common functionality for actions that operate on tag teams:
 * - Centralized repository access through dependency injection
 * - Status transition management capabilities for employment, retirement, etc.
 * - Foundation for tag team-related business operations
 * - Standardized repository access patterns
 * - Multi-member management for wrestlers and managers
 *
 * TAG TEAM LIFECYCLE STATES:
 * 1. Created (unemployed) - Tag team exists but not available for competition
 * 2. Employed - Available for matches and championship opportunities
 * 3. Suspended - Employed but temporarily restricted from competition
 * 4. Released - Employment ended, no longer with promotion
 * 5. Retired - Partnership ended, permanently unavailable for competition
 * 6. Deleted - Soft deleted, can be restored
 *
 * MEMBER MANAGEMENT:
 * - Must have exactly 2 wrestlers at all times (wrestlerA and wrestlerB)
 * - Can have 0 or more managers
 * - All employment actions cascade to available members
 * - Member changes require proper date tracking for partnerships
 *
 * Note: Tag teams cannot be injured (only individual wrestlers can be)
