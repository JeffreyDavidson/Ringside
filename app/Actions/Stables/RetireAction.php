     * This handles the complete stable retirement workflow with cascading effects:
     * - Validates the stable can be retired (currently active/debuted)
     * - Ends current wrestler memberships (wrestlers may continue as singles/other stables)
     * - Ends current tag team memberships (tag teams may continue independently)
     * - Ends current manager relationships (managers may continue with other talent)
     * - Ends debut period if currently active
     * - Creates retirement record to formally end the stable's existence
     * - Makes the stable permanently unavailable for storylines
     * - Preserves all historical records and championship lineage
     * - Individual members may continue their careers independently

     *
     * // Retire with specific date
     * RetireAction::run($stable, Carbon::parse('2024-12-31'));
