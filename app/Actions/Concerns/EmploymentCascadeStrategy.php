/**
 * Employment cascade strategies for automatic relationship-based employment.
 *
 * This class provides strategies for automatically employing related entities when
 * a primary entity is employed. Common cascading scenarios include employing managers
 * when wrestlers or tag teams are employed.
 *
 * BUSINESS CONTEXT:
 * Wrestling promotions require managers to be employed in order to actively manage
 * talent. When a wrestler or tag team gets employed, their managers should also be
 * employed if they aren't already.
 *
 * DESIGN PATTERN:
 * Strategy pattern - each method returns a callable strategy that can be used
 * with StatusTransitionPipeline.withCascade().
 *
 * @example
 * ```php
 * // Employ a wrestler and automatically employ their managers
 * StatusTransitionPipeline::employ($wrestler, $date)
 *     ->withCascade(EmploymentCascadeStrategy::managers())
 *     ->execute();
 *
 * // Employ a tag team and cascade to wrestlers and managers
 * StatusTransitionPipeline::employ($tagTeam, $date)
 *     ->withCascade(EmploymentCascadeStrategy::wrestlers())
 *     ->withCascade(EmploymentCascadeStrategy::managers())
 *     ->execute();
 * ```
