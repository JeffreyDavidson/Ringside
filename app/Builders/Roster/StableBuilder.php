/**
 * Custom query builder for the Stable model.
 *
 * Provides specialized query methods for filtering stables by their activity periods
 * and business logic state. Uses activity period tracking rather than enum status
 * to determine stable state, providing more accurate business logic representation.
 *
 * ## Business Logic States
 *
 * - **Unestablished**: Created but never debuted/established
 * - **Established**: Currently active with an activity period
 * - **Disbanded**: Previously established but no current activity period
 * - **Future Establishment**: Scheduled to be established in the future
 *
 * ## Member Counting Logic
 *
 * Stables require a minimum of 3 members, where:
 * - Tag teams count as 2 members each (minimum wrestlers in a tag team)
 * - Individual wrestlers count as 1 member each
 * - Managers count as 1 member each
 *
 * ## Key Architecture Decisions
 *
 * This builder uses activity periods rather than the StableStatus enum because:
 * - Activity periods provide accurate time-based tracking
 * - Business operations (debut/disband) work with activity periods
 * - Eliminates dual status system confusion
 * - Aligns with other entity builders (Title, etc.)
 *
 * @template TModel of Stable
 *
 * @extends Builder<TModel>
 *
 * @example
 * ```php
 * // Basic activity states
 * $establishedStables = Stable::query()->established()->get();
 * $unestablishedStables = Stable::query()->unestablished()->get();
 * $disbandedStables = Stable::query()->disbanded()->get();
 *
 * // Member-based filtering
 * $readyStables = Stable::query()
 *     ->established()
 *     ->withMinimumMembers()
 *     ->get();
 *
 * $needingMembers = Stable::query()
 *     ->established()
 *     ->belowMinimumMembers()
 *     ->get();
 *
 * // Storyline booking
 * $storylineReady = Stable::query()->availableForStorylines()->get();
 * $reunionCandidates = Stable::query()->availableForReunion()->get();
 *
 * // Complex queries
 * $futureStables = Stable::query()
 *     ->withFutureEstablishment()
 *     ->with('currentWrestlers', 'currentTagTeams', 'managers')
 *     ->get();
 * ```
