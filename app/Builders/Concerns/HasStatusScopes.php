/**
 * Trait for adding activity period-related query scopes.
 *
 * Provides common query scopes for models that have activity period
 * relationships like titles and stables. These scopes help filter
 * models based on their current activity status and historical periods.
 *
 * This trait is designed to work with models that implement the
 * HasActivityPeriods trait and have relationships like:
 * - currentActivityPeriod (for currently active records)
 * - activityPeriods (for all activity period history)
 * - previousActivityPeriods (for completed periods)
 *
 * @author Your Name
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @see HasActivityPeriods For the activity period trait
 *
 * @example
 * ```php
 * // In Title or Stable model:
 * class Title extends Model
 * {
 *     use HasActivityPeriods;
 *     use HasStatusScopes;
 * }
 *
 * // Usage:
 * $activeTitles = Title::currentlyActive()->get();
 * $inactiveTitles = Title::currentlyInactive()->get();
 * $recentlyActivated = Title::activatedAfter($date)->get();
 * ```
