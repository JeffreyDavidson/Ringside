 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Referee personal identification (first and last name)
 * - Employment relationship tracking for referee contracts
 * - Personal information validation and data integrity
 * - Integration with match assignment and scheduling systems
 * - Official personnel record management for wrestling operations
